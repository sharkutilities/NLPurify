## Getting Started

The code is publically available at [**GitHub gists**](https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown) which is a simple platform for sharing *code snippets* with the community. To use the code, simply clone the code like:

```shell
git clone https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown/<HASH>.git nlp_utils
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:nlp_utils"
```

Done, you can now easily import the function with *python* notebooks/code-files like:

```python
import nlp_utils as nlpu # kept convention as `nlp` is registered in pypi
```
