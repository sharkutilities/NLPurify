Module Involved to Normalization of Text

The normalization of text involves cleaning of text/strings from
unwanted characters like double spacing, double line breaks to single
line breaks, etc. A single functional approach is designed to handle
all such user's requests.

    Normalize Whitespaces in a Text Data

    Cleaning texts of white spaces like from beginning, end, and
    also multiple white spaces does not add any value to a text and
    should thus be removed to normalize the text.

    :type  text: str
    :param text: Original string which needs to be cleaned of
        white spaces.

    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------

    The function now provides the following additional keyword
    arguments for control:

        * **lstrip** (*bool*): Left strip white space from the
            provided text. Defaults to True.
        * **rstrip** (*bool*): Right strip white space from the
            provided text. Defaults to True.
        * **multiple_whitespace** (*bool*): Delete multiple spaces
            from the text. This uses the pattern cleaning using
            regular expression. Defaults to True.

    Normalize a Text for AI/ML Operations to Reduce Randomness

    The normalization function uses the in-built string function like
    :attr:`.strip()`, :attr:`.replace()` etc. to return a cleaner
    version. The following arguments are available for more control.
    A normalized texts may have the following properties:

        * It may not start or end with a white space character,
        * It may not have double space instead of single space, and
        * It may not be spread across multiple lines (i.e., paragraphs).

    All the above properties are desired, and can improve performance
    when used to train a large language model. Normalizaton of texts
    may also involve uniform case, typically :attr:`.lower()` that
    can be used to create a word vector.

    :type  text: str
    :param text: The base uncleaned text, all the operations are
        done on this text to return a cleaner version. The string can
        be single line, multi-line (example from "text area") and can
        have any type of escape characters.

    :type  strip: bool
    :param strip: The global attribute to clean and normalize text
        of white spaces and multiple line breaks.

    **Keyword Arguments**

    All the arguments of :func:`nlpurify.normalize.strip_whitespace()`
    is accepted. In addition, the following are specific to this
    function:

        * **strip_line_breaks** (*bool*): Strip line breaks and
            returns a single line statement. This uses the os default
            which is either "CR LF" for windows or "LF" for *nix
            based systems. However, the default value can be override
            using keyword argument :attr:`line_break_seperator`.
            Defaults to False. The parameter has an overriding effect on
            the :attr:`replace_double_line_breaks`, and if True the text
            is unaltered.

        * **replace_double_line_breaks** (*bool*): Double line breaks
            are common in texts containing paragraphs. This can be
            easily replaced with a single line break character set.
            Defaults to True.

        * **line_break_seperator** (*str*): The end line character
          which is either "\\r\\n" for windows or "\\n" for *nix
          based systems. By default defaults to running operating
          systems default.
