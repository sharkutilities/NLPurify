"""
Legacy Version of NLP Utility Module

The NLP utility module is refactored and moved to a new version with
advanced collection of features. However the existing codes from the
`gist <https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown>`_ is maintained under the
legacy submodule unless dependent codes are gradually migrated.

More Information: `Issue #5 <https://github.com/sharkutilities/NLPurify/issues/5>`_
on code migrations and submodule details.

.. caution::
    The documentation does not follow PEP-8 convention, and is not maintained
    properly. This submodule is kept only as a precautionary submodule.
