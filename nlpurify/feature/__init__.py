Feature Engineering to convert Texts into a Numerical Representation

In NLP, a feature is a measurable,  numerical representation of a
characteristic of raw text. Since machine learning models cannot
understand raw text directly, we must convert unstructured text data
into a structured, numerical format that these algorithms can process.
